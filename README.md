# journowatch-spring-api-xml
Java Spring Framework Spring Security API with XML config (JavaConfig will be seperate project)

This project, while intended on being functional and robust, is being implemented with a flippancy toward presentation with respect to comments and documentation.  Potentially bad words that would not otherwise be used in an actual professional capacity contained herein.  Judge me based on the merits of what I do, not necessarily on the opinions with which I do them.
